                    <p>Hello! As the element above suggests, my name is Emerson Harmon. I'm a Georgia native interested in hiking, 
                        games, fiction, and enough other stuff to frankly take up the rest of the page. However, this page is a reflection 
                        of my interest in Web Development, which might have been obvious enough to go without saying, but I have a box to fill.
                    </p>

                    <p> I am currently enrolled part-time at Emory University as an undergrad, but what's of more relevance to this webpage is 
                        the professional development class I'm taking at Georgia Tech: the Coding BootCamp Web Development Course. 
                        This page is the beginning of my career as a web developer. It is hosted and published on GitHub, and was created over a period of
                        5 days, though as the commit log will tell you some of those days were more intensive than others. 
                    </p>
                    <p> This website should scale well for all devices, as it uses CSS media queries to adapt the layout of the content. Gonna put a little more text
                        here to fill out the box and visually balance the other paragraphs. Recently I've found that I work particularly well when I have a Bob Ross 
                        video on in the background. You should try it!
