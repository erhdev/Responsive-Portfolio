                    <p>Hello! As the element above suggests, my name is Emerson Harmon. I'm a Georgia native interested in hiking, 
                        games, fiction, and enough other stuff to frankly take up the rest of the page. However, this page is a reflection 
                        of my interest in Web Development, which might have been obvious enough to go without saying, but I have a box to fill.
                    </p>

                    <p> I am currently enrolled part-time at Emory University as an undergrad, but what's of more relevance to this webpage is 
                        the professional development class I'm taking at Georgia Tech: the Coding BootCamp Web Development Course. 
                        This page is the beginning of my career as a web developer. It is hosted and published on GitHub, and was created over a period of
                        5 days, though as the commit log will tell you some of those days were more intensive than others. 
                    </p>
                    <p> The requirements on this website, (namely, the 960px width of this content block) mean that it won't always scale well 
                        for every viewport, but if you run it at around 1552 pixels wide it'll look clean as a whistle. 

                    </p>
